        <h3>
            Introduction to Data/Data Privacy 
        </h3>
        <p>
        &emsp;According to cloudflare data privacy is generally the ability of a person to determine for themselves when, how and to what extent their personnel information about them is shared with and communicated to others.  
        <br>
        Data privacy is important for several reasons, one of which is that as online platforms and social media sites collect more information than perhaps would be expected or indeed should be allowed, this information is not necessarily well guarded. This can lead to large data breaches that expose the users of these sites’ data that is then spread to the far corners of the internet and can be used by all sorts of people to  do bad things, such as identity theft. That is not even taking into account the issue of when these companies sell your data for to other companies, without the consent of the user in question. 
        </br>
        &emsp;Another important aspect to data privacy is that having no data privacy means that everyone knows everything you are doing, including those who may want to harm you, these people can then use this information to track you wherever you may go. This is especially the case under repressive governments that may restrict their citizens right to speak freely.

            Dangers of Unsecure Data

        <h3>
            Keeping your Data Safe 
        </h3>
        <p>
        &emsp;One of the most basic things that can be done online to protect data privacy is to stop oversharing on social media. This means that you only tell people what you absolutely need to tell them online, no need to give out personally identifying information, especially not things like your home address, your social security number or any credit or debit card information or your driver's license number. Even your full name should not be given online, instead stick to usernames. In general, don’t give out any information online that you wouldn’t want a stranger you just met to have. This also includes any pictures you post online, be extremely careful with any pictures you post of you or your families as in some cases the things or information just in the background of the photo can allow someone to track you down and find out where you live, which could very well be dangerous. This also means sharing less on forms that you fill out, skipping any of the optional things that you don’t absolutely need to put down. 
        <br>
        &emsp;Another important thing is to pay attention to what companies and websites you give your data to, there is always the possibility that that company could have a security breach and now all of the data you gave them would be out there for anyone to access. Be careful of who you give your data to, do some research and make sure they have a good privacy policy in place.

        <h3>
            What to do after Data Theft 
        </h3>
        <p>
        &emsp;Sometimes it is unavoidable however, So yum ay need to go to websites like haveibeenpwned.com to see if your information has been breached, if it has you should change the passwords to those accounts as soon as possible to protect yourself from further attacks.
