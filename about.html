            Hi everyone, I am Nicholas Jacob!  I am the creator and lead of S.A.F.E. and hope to see some good come from it.  I was born in Clarksdale, MS but have lived in TN, MO, OK, FL, CA, and I'm back in AZ for the second time in my life.  I served 5 years in the Marine Corps doing aviation calibration for test equipment.  I am due to graduate UAT at the end of the spring 2023 semester with my B.S. in Network Security.

            Hello there, my name is Vanessa Bonner! I am originally from Fort Wayne, Indiana, and moved when I was around 11 or 12.
            My first school that I went to was named Bogle Junior High school in Chandler, AZ. And, from there, I have lived in Arizona for 10 or 12 years now.
            Now, I am student of UAT, going for 3 years now. Within this picture is me getting my degree at Chandler High School. In my opinion, the greatest high school I went to within Arizona.
