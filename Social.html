            <h3>
                Information that everyone knows on Social Engineering: 
            </h3>
                <p>
                    Social engineering is the act of exploiting human weaknesses to gain access to personal information and protected systems. Social engineering relies on manipulating individuals rather than hacking computer systems to penetrate a target’s account. 
                </p>
            <h3>
                Basics of Social Engineering: How does social engineering work?             </h3>
                <p>
                    <br> </br>
                    1. Social engineering hackers fabricate a pretext that is familiar to targets. 
                    <br> </br>
                    2. A social engineering attacker then preys on their cognitive biases to lull them into a false sense of security and trust. 
                    <br> </br>
                    3. Social engineering has been dramatized by Hollywood in heist films and hacker films, etc., but what these types of films have in common is that social engineering requires a great deal of research and planning.      
                </p>
            <h3>
                6 Principles of Social Engineering:
            </h3>
                <p>
                    The following principles are commonly used by scammers to foster trust and persuade their victims: 
                    <br> </br>
                    The 6 principles of social engineering are: 
                    <br> </br>
                    Authority: 
                    <br> </br>
                    Most individuals learn to respect authority as they grow older, and they rarely hesitate to comply with the instructions of someone in power. And, in this instance, social engineers impersonate others to get people to do something. For example, many have called users on the phone claiming they work for Microsoft. 
                    <br> </br>
                    Intimidation: 
                    <br> </br>
                    Scammers frequently employ intimidation to get victims to act. Intimidation might be through bullying tactics, and it is often combined with impersonating someone else. Using intimidation is most effective with impersonation and vishing (use fraudulent phone numbers, voice-altering software, text messages) attacks. 
                    <br> </br>
                    Consensus/Social Proof: 
                    <br> </br>
                    Most attackers take advantage of this by creating web sites with fake testimonials that promote a product. For example, criminals have set up some web sites with dozens of testimonials listing all the benefits of their fake antivirus software (rogueware). 
                    <br> </br>
                    Scarcity:
                    <br> </br> 
                    Scarcity is a social engineering tactic that capitalizes on the natural inclination of people to act quickly to obtain something that is rare or limited. For example, iPhone sells out quickly, a phishing email can take advantage of this and encourage users to click a link for exclusive access to a new product. And, If the users click, they’ll end up at a malicious web site 
                    <br> </br>
                    Urgency:
                    <br> </br>
                    Just as it sounds, the 5th principal urgency is used by scammers to hasten the decision-making process of their targets. Time-based psychological principles such as urgency and scarcity work well when used along with authority intimidation. 
                    <br> </br>
                    Familiarity/Liking: 
                    <br> </br> 
                    In many cases, if you like someone, you are more likely to do what the person asks. Hackers know this and try to exploit it by spoofing the accounts of friends, colleagues, or family members. 
                    <br> </br>
                    <br> </br>

                    These 6 principles are used by social engineering attackers and scammers that have the knowledge of these 6 common behavioral traits of humans to increase the effectiveness of their attacks       
                </p>
            <h3>
                Psychological Effects of Social Engineering:  
            </h3>
                <p>
                    Regarding the psychological effects of social engineering, one of the main tools that social engineers use is called “Trust.” What is Trust? 
                    <br> </br>
                    1. Trust is the firm belief in the reliability, truth, ability, or strength of someone or something. 
                    <br> </br>
                    2. Within social engineering, trust increases our comfort level to allow us to speak and act more freely. 
                    <br> </br>
                    3. A social engineer will manipulate their target using email, phone, or in-person tactics to acquire confidential information. Through observing personal mentalities, reoccurring routines, and relationships, the social engineer can develop the appearance of an individual you might naturally trust.
